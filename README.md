# Python guide

A helpful (I hope) series of chapters designed to teach the reader Python.  
  Written for a friend.  
    
  For each chapter I will have a README.md file which will be me covering the content for that chapter, a questions.py file that has questions that I try my best to have that cover things that I introduced in the chapter, then a tests.py that you can run to make sure your answers to the questions are correct.
