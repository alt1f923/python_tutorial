# Python guide

A helpful (I hope) series of chapters designed to teach the reader Python.  
  Written for a friend.  
    
  For each chapter I will have a README.md file which will be me covering the content for that chapter, a questions.py file that has questions that I try my best to have that cover things that I introduced in the chapter, then a tests.py that you can run to make sure your answers to the questions are correct.  
  
**Chapter one**
=============
**This chapter covers:**
 * Getting started
 * What is Python
 * The Python shell
 * Expressions
 * Assignment and variables
 * Conditionals
 * Functions
 * Objects and methods
 * Types  
    
 **Chapter two**
=============
 * Not ready, but something along the lines of lists, sets, tuples, dicts, iteration, an explaination about literals, maybe some hashing (to explain dicts) and default values and *args + **kwargs for functions
